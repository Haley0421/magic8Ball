Magic8Ball
===========


This is the start of a Magic8Ball program, though it doesn't work yet.

Change it by:
1. Ask the Magic8Ball a question by storing a string in the question variable
1. Adding at least five answers your 8 Ball could give to the String[] answers. Remember to format each as a string. If you'd like your Magic 8 ball to have more than five potential answers, just increase the array's size
1. Pull out a random String from String[] answers to be the Magic 8 Ball's answer.
1. Print the randomly-chosen answer.

Happy Fortune telling
